> Being able to recognize which parts of a data visualization produce barriers for people with disabilities can be tough. But Chartability has compiled existing standards, research, and community best practices into a comprehensive set of things to look out for. Ideally, it can help folks who create visualizations really think deeply about accessibility when they design.

I'd like to get better at accessibility this year, for my websites and especially visualizations. I don't think I can ever definitely arrive at a point where I can claim to do it perfectly but getting exposure to such ideas and incorporating them slowly is a start. Chartability is a set of heuristics to help do an audit for your visualizations, and comes with a ton of resources including a [full example audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X-bDXBKjYA7iJR1pbHjf5JIsGOIclXxq7Ot0cJyOcJQ/edit?usp=sharing)  to help you understand how you can use it too.
