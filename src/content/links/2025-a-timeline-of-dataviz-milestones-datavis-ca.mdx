> The Milestones Project is a comprehensive, visual compendium of significant events in the histories of data visualization, statistical graphics and thematic cartography. This new version features an interactive timeline, an interactive map of authors' birthplaces, and a calendar of significant events in this history.

Amazing timeline tool. When did the first line chart or network diagram appear? How did we get from Edmund Halley's contour map in 1701 to ggplot2? \
