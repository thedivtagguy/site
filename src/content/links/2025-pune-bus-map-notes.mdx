> They have a habit to ask conductor about bus timings, and my map did not mention the timings- Instead of asking "does this bus goes to XYZ stand?" people ask "What bus is this?" followed by various questions. Most of the time the driver and conductor answered but when they are busy or tensed they tell people to ask their queries at the enquiry window.

We've been discussing making schematized, London-style spider-maps for BMTC bus routes over on the Bengwalk discord (which I definitely recommend joining if you live in Bangalore and are interested in public transportation) and that has sent me into a rabbit-hole of learning about octilinear, hexilinear and all those other kinds of transit maps. Professor Mundar Rane's (IDC) blog is quite a nice find for me, and this particular post discusses their process and observations on making such a bus map for Pune. It's easy to get caught up in the tech and design of things while missing things like the questions above because we take *that* for granted. Good read.
