I recently discovered the David Rumsey map archives and spent an hour or two looking through all the various tags and keywords. These maps and charts by Survey of India, mostly from 1895, are fascinating. The visualizations are clear, the maps are well-designed, and it is a pleasure to browse through. Not to be one to hark back to the supposed greatness of the past, but this is clearly leagues better than the kind of work we see come out of government publications today.
