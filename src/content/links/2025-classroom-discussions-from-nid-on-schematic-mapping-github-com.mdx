Everything about this thread is wonderful. Rasagy Sharma and Arun Ganesh run a digital cartography module at National Institute of Design, Bangalore and this repository contains all their course materials and resources. What is even better is that *student* discussions and assignments are also public! You can see progress being made and iterations happen. The other 'Issues' on the repo are also worth strolling through. \

As someone who restricts themselves to 'available' shapefiles for work and doesn't really map from scratch, this is really educational for me too. \
\
By far the coolest classroom I can imagine.
