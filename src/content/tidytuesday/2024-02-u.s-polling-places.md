description: "I mapped addresses of U.S polling places and plotted their locations (probably a population map lol). Geocoding was an interesting challenge; I found out that the Census website provides a nice generous\_[API](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/Geocoding_Services_API.html). Processed in R but mapped in QGIS (whoops).\_A pretty simple visualization for this week, but getting geocoding to work was fun. It took around 4 hours to run through the full dataset in batches of 9999 addresses each.\n"
