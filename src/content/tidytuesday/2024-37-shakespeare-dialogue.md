  After a long time away from Tidytuesday, I made a fairly straightforward
  graphic showing how the 'prominence' of characters changes as the three plays
  go from Act I to Act V. Represented with a bump chart, the characters are
  ranked by how much dialogue they have in that particular act and scene.
