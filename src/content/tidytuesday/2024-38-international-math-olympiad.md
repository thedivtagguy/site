  This week's dataset was on every country's scores and medals in the
  International Math Olympiad. I wanted to visualize both overall medal count
  and how rankings have fluctuated over the years. The small multiples are
  actually bump charts! Perhaps a little overwhelming, but I enjoyed using the
  `{patchwork}` package.
