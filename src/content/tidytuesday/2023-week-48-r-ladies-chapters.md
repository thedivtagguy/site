  For [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday?src=hashtag_click)
  week 47, we looked at [@RLadiesGlobal](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal) 
  chapters, and I probably overdid things. Tbh, I just wanted to use the OpenAI
  embeddings API to cluster similar chapters but one thing led to another and
  well yeah, I made a dashboard. You can search by topic or locations. All the
  processing for the data was done in R and the website is (obviously) built
  with Sveltekit. I used the OpenAI APIs to extract keywords for tagging and to
  'recommend' chapters based on the kind of events they host. It cost me
  \~$0.90.
