  :)

  ### What do I do these days?


  Since 2023, I have been working as a full-time web and data visualization
  developer at [Revisual Labs](https://revisual.co/). I make charts, websites
  and other interactive web thingies on a daily basis.


  ### Why?


  It's fun, I like it. It marries my interests of making things go brrr and
  design. I've also been freelancing in similar areas since 2021.

  I haven't been reading much lately. But I did pick up Good Omens again this
  year. I had a bet with R that we'd read 10 books this year. She got as far as
  5. I did about 0.5.
extracurricular: >
  I've started running. Wondering how long that'll hold up. I do the NYT Mini,
  Wordle and Connections everyday religiously.

      1. Graduated with Bachelor's of Design from Srishti. Yelahanka had been my
      home for four amazing years so it was hard to say goodbye. On the other
      hand, I had had enough of college. But home is home.

      2. Gurman hired me at Revisual Labs, an information design studio she had
      just started. It has been an exciting few months.

      3. Searched for apartments, got an apartment. On Twitter of all places.
      I'll be sharing it with a friend I've known for almost 18 years now.

      4. Stayed at my OG home with family for almost 6 months, a much needed
      break after college. Watched Seinfeld a lot. Seriously. We can quote
      specific breaths of air from each episode.

      5. Watched Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Ghum. Yeah, that was something. Needs its
      own bullet-point. Gawd.

      6. Hosted a farewell, wrote a thesis.

      1. Interned with Reuters Graphics, which was a *huge* moment for me. I've
      been stalking data viz gods on the internet for so long and to be among
      them? Crazy.

      2. Got my first byline two days after I joined the
      [team](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/AFGHANISTAN-QUAKE/akvezlnropr/)
      for a little chart I made. Watching a breaking news story develop was
      incredibly exciting. Over the next four months, I would work on various
      stories in different capacities; from analyzing Brazil election data to
      visualizing the floods in Pakistan.

      3. My friends and I hosted two major events in college (and may I add,
      despite college). It was a huge success. The same group would host the
      farewell next year.

      4. Got bored, started [Times of
      Srishti](https://www.instagram.com/timesofsrishti/) and accidentally
      garnered a cult following (faculty included). It was anonymous while I ran
      it and so it was fun to see people react genuinely to something I had
      written.

      5. Went to Ooty with two of my best-friends R and S.

In no particular order, here are some things happening in my life right now:

I've been studying statistics in my free time. My evenings and weekends go mostly in that. Glasses are now absolutely necessary for me. I often forget them. If I see you on the street and don't nod or smile in acknowledgement, know that it isn't out of rudeness but because you're a blob to me. I've been obsessed with Sherlock Holmes and Jeremy Brett this year. I've re-read the Doyle stories for the 3rd time now. I don't know what fascinates me about them? This year, I decided to try and get back in touch with old friends from past lives. It's a process but one I want to do well. I got lucky and found L and A from Montreal (which I left in 2012) and was pleasantly surprised to know that they still remembered me. If we've lost touch, I'd love to reconnect with you as well. Please send me an email.
