**What it is**: The cartography lab at the University of Madison has a very good and _complete_ tutorial on how to start with QGIS, work with a dataset to visualize it, considerations to keep in mind while styling and annotating details on maps and much more. A little mapping knowledge never goes waste.

**What it is**: In a time of quick Reels and opinionated Twitter threads, I find writings like these very enjoyable.

Also see the [why](https://indieweb.org/why) and [life happens](https://indieweb.org/life_happens). If we're talking about principles, [here's a boatload of them](https://principles.adactio.com/) .

**What it is**: This is the first time I've seen a blobby voronoi and I love it! It works both like a voronoi visualization and a heatmap. The authors also published a detail [behind-the-scenes](https://observablehq.com/@fil/how-we-made-waves-of-interest), definitely something I want to mess around with later.
