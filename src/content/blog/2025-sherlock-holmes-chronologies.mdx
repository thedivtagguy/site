> "Never has so much written by so many for the benefit of so few"

This one is going to sound a little "out there" to a lot of you, but here it goes. Bear with me. There's dataviz at the end I swear. 

I don't think I can fully explain the origins, rationale and history of this entire movement in this blogpost, because it literally spans years and more words than I can dedicate to it, the TL;DR is this: there's a bunch of us who play a little Game. It's a Game with a capital G because its been going on since at least the 1940s. The premise of the game is this: Sherlock Holmes was a real man, he lived and walked the streets of London with Watson, his actual biographer. The stories, the incidents (perhaps mildly changed to protect identities), the crimes; are all real. Arthur Conan Doyle was merely a literary agent who, in cahoots with Watson, got these stories to us. Given that these stories are real, the Game is to figure out all we possibly can about the real incidents and the life of Sherlock Holmes.

Now, of course, I am not an idiot (in other ways yes but not here, lest those of you who are less whimsically-inclined consign me to that category). But it's quite fun if you lean into it. If you're struggling to find a way to politely phrase "But why...?" in your head, it helps understanding it as any other form of fanfiction. Except it's probably one of the most seriously-taken forms of fanfiction there is. 

As I write this, the Baker Street Irregulars are meeting in New York, as they do every year, to honor Sherlock Holmes on his birthday, January 6th. There are Holmes societies all over the world who meet regularly to discuss the Canon (as the original 60 stories are called) and surrounding topics. There are publications upon publications of Sherlockian scholarship since 1978, there are blogs, podcasts (the longest running of which has been going on close to 17 years!) and I could go on. I love it. I will talk more about how I engage with it in another post BUT BUT BUT, let me get to the point. 

One of the biggest areas of contention and Sherlock scholarship has been the question of The Chronology. Capital letters again for effect. The Chronology refers to the issue of resolving _when_
