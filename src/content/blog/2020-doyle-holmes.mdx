Over the past two months, I’ve made headway into doing something I had been planning for a very long time. I’ve finally read the four Sherlock Holmes novels and over a dozen of the short stories. I’m still a long way from exhausting the latter but it’s progress. I’ve thought about something while reading the stories: I think that there are some writers, or artists, who just don’t feel connected to what they’ve written. For example, Michael Crichton, of Jurassic Park and ER fame, was a tall, lively man whose pictures and interviews paint the image of a man who was intelligent, confident and humorous; an Ian Malcolm if there ever was one. Or John Steinbeck, the author of Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, smoked cigarettes while wearing a look of self-assurance that one of his characters from Canary Row would have had.

The only author I can think of who is so incredibly different and dare I say, inconsistent, from his own creation would be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. If you’ve been anything like me, you’ve probably never taken time to read through the original stories. You’ve seen the Robert Downey Jr. movies, you’ve seen the Benedict Cumberbatch or the Jeremy Brett version, you might have even heard of some of the many cartoons that recreate Holmes ([sometimes even as a dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Hound)) and in thinking of Conan Doyle between all of this, it would not be unlikely that you echo what T.S Eliot said in 1929, “What has he got to do with Holmes?”. What has he, indeed? Reading the stories, the characters and plots are so incredibly well-fleshed out that you forget that it is a story, and not a real account. A lot of things seem to corroborate Eliot’s remark. In the city of Edinburgh, his birthplace, the ‘Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’ memorial is a statue of Holmes. There is[ The Oscar Wilde Society](https://oscarwildesociety.co.uk/), [The Dickens Society](https://dickenssociety.org/), the three Brontë sisters have their own [society](https://www.bronte.org.uk/bronte-200/join-the-bronte-society), a search for a society for Mark Twain gives me at least 5 different names, numerous societies dedicated to Shakespeare (including [an entire village](http://www.natgeotraveller.in/finding-shakespeare-and-brecht-in-karnatakas-tiny-village-of-heggodu/), a 4-hour drive from where I live) and so on, you get the idea. But there is a singular [Sherlock Holmes Society](https://www.sherlock-holmes.org.uk/), celebrating the character rather than the author. In America, even during the time Doyle was alive, lax copyright laws led to what was almost ‘permitted piracy’ of the Holmes stories. He wasn’t too happy, but to quote Eliot again, ‘What has he got to do with Holmes?’. Thanks to it now being in the public domain, we’ve seen shows like Elementary and Enola Holmes, or books by new authors which seem to further dwarf Doyle and make him seem almost inessential to the existence of the character.

It gets even more irregular when you consider his friendship with Harry Houdini, the illusionist. Arthur Conan Doyle was a staunch believer in spiritualism, the belief that we can communicate with the dead. Yes. The creator of the most rational, cold, logical mind in all of literature believed in ouija boards, spirits, mediums; you know, the works. Doyle also believed, without a shred of doubt, that Houdini was using some supernatural powers to perform his escape-acts. Houdini, a little insulted I imagine, gave Doyle proof that there was no such thing and it was all a result of intense practice and well-planned illusions but Doyle stood his ground. Their relationship became bumpy, with Doyle arguing that Houdini was coming up with elaborate explanations to conceal his powers. They fell out soon after. Oh, and by the way, the same man also went on to write the sentence, “The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply.” in The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire, a Holmes short story.

What an interesting little man.

I could go on endlessly about all the little details on why I feel Doyle feels so disconnected with what he created but instead here are some general things that I’ve turned over in my mind after a good two months of engaging with Doyle and Holmes:

1. You and what you do can have a working relationship, you don’t need to love it all the time. Despite the popular success of Sherlock Holmes even in his time, Doyle felt that he was wasting time on something that was cheap and low brow. He grew so sick of his creation that he killed it off in the story ‘The Final Problem’ but had to bring him back after unceasing protests by his readers. He isn’t the only author who grew to hate their own work.[ A.A Milne hated Pooh](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160128-a-a-milne-and-the-curse-of-pooh-bear), Agatha Christie[ disliked Poirot](http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/devon/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_9131000/9131482.stm), Louisa May Alcott [disliked ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/12/25/girls-adored-little-women-louisa-may-alcott-did-not/)Little Women, the list really is endless. I think we as artists are our own severest critics and quite frankly, the worst judges of our work.
2. Hating your own work is a great motivator. It pushed Doyle into immersing himself into writing nine incredibly detailed historical works and stories like The Lost World (which, I think, might even have served as an inspiration to Jurassic Park) with greater care. He didn’t want to be remembered for Holmes and he did everything in his creative power to ensure that.
3. The conflict between your personal beliefs, or knowledge, and your artistic work can lead to something great. In The Hound of the Baskervilles, a book about an apparently demonic dog who is out to kill the Baskerville family, Doyle writes a character who rubbishes these fancy ideas and argues over and over for a scientific, reasonable explanation. I imagine that if he were real and should engage in a conversation with Doyle, he would admonish and mock him for the beliefs on spiritualism he held. I wonder, after reading lines such as “It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.” and “I never guess. It is a shocking habit—destructive to the logical faculty”, whether Doyle was using Holmes to write arguments against himself, engaging in a conversation of sorts. To create a character who is so antithetical to what you stand for must have been a freeing exercise, allowing him to think a greater deal than he would have if he wrote about something he knew and believed in.
4. It’s fine to view something you’re working on as a trifling moment in your life and imagine you were meant for greater things, but that’s no reason to slack on it. For all the hate he had for detective stories that he considered undignified, Doyle put his all into it. All of his stories, even the ones he was forced to write after bringing Sherlock back from the dead, are flawless and are analyzed in detail to this day.  To quote Holmes, ‘To a great mind, nothing is little’.
5. Drop the delusions of grandeur. In the long run, you aren’t really all that important. People care more about what is created rather than who created it.
