Last week I wrote about something clever I came up with for the Who is my neta dashboard. Gave myself a pat on the back for that one, maybe even a scratch behind the ear on a job well done. 

Now let's talk about one of the stupidest things I've made so far, which also happened in the same project. Such is the duality of a man. 

I made this visualization. A bar-histo-chart embarrassment.

Here is the thought process, brought to you by my head: On the left is a selector for various topics of discussion in the parliament. This was meant to show how many questions an MP had asked for that topic and how many other MPs had asked the same amount of questions as them. The idea being that you could see your MP's activity relative to others.

If a "simple" viz takes that much of an explanation, it's probably bad. And it was. This confused the heck out of everyone. I don't blame them.

Wait there's more

These are only a small sample of people who were nice enough to point this out. The real number of casualties that had to suffer this chart may run in thousands if not millions (figuring conservatively). 

Sometimes if I squint I'm pretty sure even I can't understand it. 

So what went wrong?
