Like many before me, I have spent more time optimizing my writing stack than actually making it work for me.

I am _trying_ to get better at it. I write quite often, actually, but none of it ever seems refined enough to put it up here. That is a little habit I'm trying to leave behind now. Every weekend, I try to write something that even if I don't share, gets _written_. 

One of the biggest pain points about blogging with a site like mine is that it isn't something like Wordpress. I'll explain what I mean by that in a bit. I started off learning how to make websites, way back in 2013, with Wordpress. My experience with adding content, creating pages, writing blogs was within the confines of the Wordpress admin UI. And its a _great UI_. When I say that my current fancy-dandy website isn't like Wordpress, its because most of the static-site generators I have used are geared towards developers and _not_ people who want to just write. Unless you're using a ready-made Hugo, Jekyll, Astro theme, you're setting up everything on your own, from the folders where the text files go to the markdown parsing to rendering it correctly on your page. Its not the process of writing gets harder; if anything it is even more simplified. Markdown is a wonderful. Its the paraphernalia _around_
