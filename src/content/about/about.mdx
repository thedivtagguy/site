thanks: >
  I've been fortunate to meet certain people beyond my family and close friends
  who've significantly shaped my professional, ethical, and moral standards.
  Their influence has been profound, maybe more than they realize, and continues
  to shape my growth. I hope to pass on the kindness they've shown me to others
  someday.

I wish I could tell you where I'm from with the certainty that others seem to have. In India, everyone seems to have their specific 'village' or city, a place they call home and go back to; something that anchors them. So this question is more than just small talk; it's a way people size you up because it's not just about where you're from, but what that place might say about you. Telling someone you are from Delhi slots you into a very different mold than if you tell them you're from Patna.

By the time I had reached 20, I had changed 10 schools, 3 countries and 7 cities. As such, I am very geographically and culturally confused. I was born in the city of Bilaspur, Chattisgarh which is in central India. Since then, I have lived in the island of Kulhudhuffushi in the Maldives (I miss the sea), Montreal in Quebec (I miss the poutine), Dehradun in Uttarakhand (I miss the mountains), Mangalore in coastal Karnataka (I miss winters), and finally for now, Bangalore. Since 2016 I've been telling people I'm from Mangalore so I guess I'll say that to you too. I quite like Bangalore though, so in a few years I'll tell people that is where I'm from. You can't trust me with this.

I got into visual arts through [photography](https://www.instagram.com/thedivtagguy/), I love shooting in infrared and monochrome. I then picked up graphic design and some 3D skills too (I'm not too shabby at it). I've always liked websites though, so over the past few years I've pivoted to programming and data visualization. But I think you already knew that.

Uhhh, what else? I'm afraid of cows.
